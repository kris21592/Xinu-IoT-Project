Abstract:
This project presents the implementation of a device driver for a temperature sensor TMP36, an LDR, 
a Button and an LED in the Internet of Things. It allows the processes in the XINU Operating
System to access and utilize the devices connected to BeagleBone Black (BBB) Device through a
computer and remotely through a network. The devices connected to the BBB can communicate to
each other as well as the devices connected to another BBB. The project is divided into two parts.
First part deals with interfacing the devices with the GPIO and writing the low-level device driver
functions. A Device Description Language (DDL) is used to specialize the device drivers to the BBB.
The DDL, when processed at compile time, and generates the high-level codes for the devices. In
the second part, we establish a high-level abstraction of the device on an Edge Device and the
Cloud. The Edge reads the DDL file to enable access and establish an edge hosted version of the
device. A web based dashboard is developed to view and monitor the status of all the devices.



Introduction:

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the internetworking of physical devices, vehicles (&quot;connected
devices/smart devices&quot;), buildings and other itemsâ€”embedded with electronics, software, sensors,
actuators, and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data. The IoT
allows objects to be sensed and/or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure,
creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based
systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy, and economic benefit. When IoT is
augmented with sensors and actuators, the technology becomes an instance of the more general
class of cyber-physical systems, which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, smart
homes, intelligent transportation and smart cities. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its
embedded computing system but can interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure.
